This R markdown file refactors prior code for data cleaning 

1) Develop tables and plots for Chapter 2 

Data:
Predominant datasets used are:  
1) USGS daily streamflow and station metadata,  
2) Summary data from a QGIS analysis of ungaged watersheds of interest.  

Approach: 
1) find potential USGS gages by bounding box 
     bBox = a contiguous range of decimal latitude and longitude, starting 
     with the west longitude, then the south latitude, then the east longitude, 
     and then the north latitude with each value separated by a comma. 
# https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Service.html#bBox 
# the Pine Ridge Reservation boundary is c(-103.0, 43.0, -100.2, 43.8)

2) filter gages for the following reasons
     - upstream control, 
     - in crystaline or karst catchments
     - provisional data 
     - (sigh) overlooked in the first data screening from 1990-2017 

3) clean metadata by removing non-needed variables  

4) obtain USGS gage daily flow data

5) filter stations based on record length 
    - no data gages for 1980-2018 water years 
    - less than 6-years of continuous data for 1990-2018
      for filtering info see: https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/site_tp_cd 

6) create metadata tables 
    - gage_table - summary of gage metadata 
    - ung_table - summary of ungaged watershed metadata 
    - soils_table - summary of geology, soils, and vegetation 

7) prepare daily flow data for PCA 
     - check missing records & filter 
     - remove provincial data 
     - eliminate watershed size effects: 
          Daily flow depth is calculated by dividing flow (cms) by watershed 
          area (sq-km) and multiply the resultant by num. of sec. in a day.  
          The resulting unit is cu-m-d per sq-km. 
     - transform the data by BoxCox transformation by forcast::BoxCox
          The daily flow data are highly skewed.  BoxCox transformation uses 
          maximum likelihood to identify a best value (lambda) that best 
          transforms a dataset to an ~ normal distribution.

          # this is table of what the lambda values (probably) mean
          # lambda = 1 is normal distribution (no change), 
          # lambda = 0.5 is a square-root transformation, 
          # lamda = 2 is a square transformation,
          # lambda = 0 is a logrithmic transformation.

8) make a PCA matrix and tidy the output 
     - used prcomp() with center & scale = TRUE to center the data with a 
         mean of zero and standard deviation of unity, e.g. a z-score.  
         Note: '.' passes select(q1_tr, q7_tr, q30_tr) %>% to prcomp() 
     - found eigenvectors-- the results about the PC axes

9) construct bootstrap confidence intervals of PC axes to identify a difference 
     in means. We obtained a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) around the our  
     estimate of the mean difference. The 95% indicates that any such confidence 
     interval will capture the population mean difference 95% of the time. 
     That is to say, we can be 95% confident the interval contains the true mean  
     of the population.  We can calculated the 95% CI of the mean difference by 
     performing bootstrap resampling (Bradley Efron).

     The bootstrap creates multiple resamples (with replacement) from a single 
     set of observations, and computes the effect size of interest on each of 
     these resamples. The bootstrap resamples of the effect size can then be 
     used to determine the 95% CI.

     The resampling distribution of the difference in means approaches a normal 
     distribution. This is due to the Central Limit Theorem: a large number of 
     independent random samples will approach a normal distribution even if the 
     underlying population is not normally distributed.

# Bootstrap resampling gives us two important benefits:

# Non-parametric statistical analysis. There is no need to assume that our 
# observations, or the underlying populations, are normally distributed. 
# Thanks to the Central Limit Theorem, the resampling distribution of the 
# effect size will approach a normality.
# Easy construction of the 95% CI from the resampling distribution. 
# For 1000 bootstrap resamples of the mean difference, one can use the 25th 
# value and the 75th value of the ranked differences as boundaries of the 
# 95% confidence interval. (This captures the central 95% of the distribution.) 
# Such an interval construction is known as a percentile interval.

# Adjusting for asymmetrical resampling distributions
# While resampling distributions of the difference in means often have a normal 
# distribution, it is not uncommon to encounter a skewed distribution. Thus, 
# Efron developed the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (BCa bootstrap) 
# to account for the skew, and still obtain the central 95% of the distribution. 
# dabestr applies the BCa correction to the resampling bootstrap distributions 
# of the effect size.

# Estimation plots incorporate bootstrap resampling
# The estimation plot produced by dabest presents the rawdata and the 
# bootstrap confidence # interval of the effect size (the difference in means) 
# side-by-side as a single integrated plot. It thus tightly couples visual 
# presentation of the raw data with an indication of the population mean 
# difference, and its confidence interval.

# another approach & why 
# Simple Splitting with Important Groups

# In some cases there is an important qualitative factor in the data 
# that should be considered during (re)sampling. For example:
# in clinical trials, there may be hospital-to-hospital differences
# with longitudinal or repeated measures data, subjects (or general 
# independent experimental unit) may have multiple rows in the data set, etc.

# There may be an interest in making sure that these groups are not contained 
# in the training and testing set since this may bias the test set performance 
# to be more optimistic. Also, when one or more specific groups are held out, 
# the resampling might capture the “ruggedness” of the model. In the example 
# where clinical data is recorded over multiple sites, the resampling 
# performance estimates partly measure how extensible the model is across sites.

#To split the data based on groups, groupKFold can be used:

#set.seed(3527)
#subjects <- sample(1:20, size = 80, replace = TRUE)
#table(subjects)

set.seed(123)
