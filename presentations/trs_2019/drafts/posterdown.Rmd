# Research Motivation 

* Streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds are needed for hydrologic studies on Tribal lands.
* Watershed storages may provide useful metrics to improve streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds.
* Accurate watershed storage measurement is difficult because storages vary in time and space 
* Top-down approaches to classify gaged watersheds and identify key hydrologic landscape parameters may improve streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds.

# Hydrologic Group Classification

The ecological regions in the study area are a complex mosaic of geologic, biologic, physiologic, soils, and land use patterns that both influence and are influenced by the regional hydrology (Omernik 1995; Omernik and Bailey 1997).  The northern portion of the study area is primarily within the Northwestern Great Plains ecoregion, and includes segments of the Northern Rockies, and Western High Plains ecoregions (Bryce et al. 2003).  Regional climate and stream morphology are influenced by the Black Hills uplift during the Laramide orogeny which elevated the Black Hills into a broad-backed anticlinal dome with progressively younger strata dipping away from its crystalline center (Martin et al. 2004).  The northwestern and highest elevation portion of the study area is within the Black Hills Plateau and Black Hills Foothills ecoregions (table 2).  The Black Hills Plateau and Black Hills Foothills ecoregions exhibit greater forest cover, higher precipitation and lower air temperature variation than the surrounding plains (Hall et al. 2002).  Black Hills Plateau rock units are made up primarily of limestones and sandstones, and Black Hills Foothills rock units of the are made up primarily of sandstones, siltstones, and claystones.  The Pierre Shale Plains and Sagebrush Steppe ecoregions surround the Black Hills Foothills and extend along the northern portion of the study area (Bryce et al. 2003).  The White River Badlands ecoregion in the center of the study area are composed of clay and siltstones from sediments eroded from the Black Hills and intermixed with volcanic ash layers (Benton et al. 2015).  The White River Badlands ecoregion grades into the Keya Paha Tablelands ecoregion, which are composted of soft sandstones and siltstones.  The forested sandstone Pine Ridge Escarpment bisects the Keya Paha Tablelands, forming the boundary between the Missouri Plateau ecoregion to the north and the High Plains ecoregion to the south.  The Nebraska Sand Hills ecoregion in the southern portion of the study area is a mostly treeless region of grass-stabilized Quaternary-age dunes overlying the rock units forming the Keya Paha Tablelands. The Nebraska Sand Hills are a major recharge zone for the High Plains aquifer, with groundwater supporting relatively constant baseflow to streams in the Nebraska Sandhills region.  

## Objectives
1. Classify gaged watersheds into hydrologic groups.  
2. Test whether hydrologic landscape variable inclusion improves the accuracy of streamflow prediction for ungaged watersheds 
3. Identify key hydrologic landscape variables for regional-scale hydrologic models.
3. Determine spatial and temporal effects of watershed storage on streamflow.


# Methods

1. Classify streamflow  gaged stations.
2. Develop hydrologic landscape parameters using GIS software [@R-rmarkdown]. 
2. Train penalized generalized linear models (GLMs) using mean daily streamflow depths (q1) as response variables and hydrologic landscape metrics explanatory variables .  We used repeated 5-fold cross-validation 
3. Evaluate the fitted models using a 20% q1-stratified holdout partition.  

# Key Findings

1. The hydrologic landscape GLM using all of the observations outperformed a null model.  
2. Hydrologic export and watershed storage capacity varies significantly by ecoregion.
3. Hydrologic conductivity and antecedent moisture conditions are other important variables determining key watershed storage pathways.

# Discussion 
Watersheds in ecoregions in the study area characterized as low storage capacity watersheds exhibit low overall hydrologic export, high antecedent moisture condition dependence, with key flow paths from storage to streamflow occurring during mid-range to dry conditions.  Watersheds in ecoregions characterized as moderate storage capacity watersheds exhibit moderate hydrologic export, low annual-scale and moderate multi-year scale streamflow depth variation, with key flow paths from overland flow to watershed storage occurring during moist to mid-range antecedent moisture conditions.  Watersheds in ecoregions characterized as high storage capacity watersheds exhibit high mean streamflow depths magnitudes with low annual and multi-year scale streamflow depth variation, with key flow paths from overland flow to watershed storage occurring during moist to mid-range antecedent moisture conditions.
