TO DO LIST 
1. Figure out the bibliography.  
3. Think about how to incorporate this into a streamflow predication model.

# Research Motivation 

* Streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds are needed for hydrologic studies on Tribal lands.
* Watershed storages may provide useful metrics to improve streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds.
* Accurate watershed storage measurement is difficult because storages vary in time and space. 
* Top-down approaches to classify gaged watersheds and identify key hydrologic landscape parameters may improve streamflow estimates for ungauged watersheds.

* Semi-arid mid-latitude cold-steppe climate (BSk) in southwestern South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska. 
* USGS streamflow gages (N = 42) in undammed, non-karstic sedimentary watersheds for water years 1980-2018.

# Hydrologic Group Classification
* Unsupervised classification of log-transformed daily (q1), 7-day (q7), and 30-day (q30) flow depths by a finite mixture model (figure 2).  
* Supervised classification using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap of ecoregions (figure 3) after a PCA transform.

# Hydrologic landscape parameter development 
* GIS‐derived metrics following the hydrologic landscape conceptual framework (Winter 2001, Epting et al. 2018).  
* GLM inputs calculated as zonal statistics following watershed boundaries: 3 planimetric, 4 elevation-derived, 4 climate, 1 land cover, and 3 soils-based metrics (table 1).

```

# Hypothesis testing
* Penalized generalized linear models (GLMs) trained with 80/20 splits and 5-fold cross-validation. q1 are response variables, and hydrologic landscape metrics are explanatory variables (table 1). 
* Evaluated GLM predictions to null models of mean daily flow depths (figure 4).

glm_table <- import("data/ecoplot.png")  

# image size is [1:2100, 1:2700]

```

# Key Findings
3. Hydrologic conductivity and antecedent moisture conditions are other important variables determining key watershed storage pathways.  
1. The hydrologic landscape GLM using all of the observations outperformed a null model.  
2. Hydrologic export and watershed storage capacity varies significantly by ecoregion.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable).
Or with figures: , or Figure \@ref(fig:study_area).

# Discussion 
Watersheds in ecoregions in the study area characterized as low storage capacity watersheds exhibit low overall hydrologic export, high antecedent moisture condition dependence, with key flow paths from storage to streamflow occurring during mid-range to dry conditions.  Watersheds in ecoregions characterized as moderate storage capacity watersheds exhibit moderate hydrologic export, low annual-scale and moderate multi-year scale streamflow depth variation, with key flow paths from overland flow to watershed storage occurring during moist to mid-range antecedent moisture conditions.  Watersheds in ecoregions characterized as high storage capacity watersheds exhibit high mean streamflow depths magnitudes with low annual and multi-year scale streamflow depth variation, with key flow paths from overland flow to watershed storage occurring during moist to mid-range antecedent moisture conditions.
