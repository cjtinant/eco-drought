"Finding your bug is a process of confirming the many things that you believe are true — until you find one which is not true." -- Norm Matloff  

## Research Motivation  

* **A majority of streams** on the *Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations* in SW South Dakota **lack streamflow records**.

* Watersheds in the region seem to differ by **watershed storage** -- which is  *difficult to measure directly* and *varies in time and space*.  

* **Top-down modeling approaches** might be a useful approach for *watershed classification* and *hydrologic parameter identification*.  

* **Broad research purpose** is to *extend short station records* and **estimate streamflow for ungaged watersheds** for the region.  

<!-- 
* **Watershed storages** may provide *useful metrics* to improve streamflow estimates.  

* **Modeling** watershed storages is necessary because *storages vary in time and space* and are difficult to measure.

## Description of study area & data  
- SW South Dakota and NW Nebraska - semi-arid mid-latitude climate (BSk) -- wet springs, hot summers, dry cold winters. 
- USGS stream gage (N = 42) records -- non-karstic sedimentary watersheds -- no dams -- for water years 1980-2018.

## Classification approach
- Box-Cox transform of daily (q1), 7-day (q7) and 30-day (q30) flow depths.  

- **Unsupervised classification** using a finite mixture model (Fraley 2016).  

- **Supervised classification**  by a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping by ecoregion (DiCiccio, Thomas, and Bradley Efron, 1996).

## Finite mixture model classification  
<!-- 
code below sets up a two-panel format  
-->  
  
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:43%'>  
- Soft clusters identified streamflow 'type'.  
- Type-1 ~ low flows ~ correlates with q1 and q7;  
- Type-9 ~ high flows ~ correlates with q30.  
- **Lots of overlap**, note increasing hydrologic export among ecoregions...
- *X-axis ~ hydrologic export and Y-axis ~ streamflow evenness (q30 - q1)*.  
</div>

```{r mclust, echo=FALSE,  out.width='91%'}

```
</div>  
  
## Bootstrapped estimates by ecoregion  
  
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>  
- **Hydrologic export** (PC1) among ecoregions are **significantly different at the 95% CI**.  
- **Evenness** (PC2) groups into low evenness (e.g. 'flashy' watersheds) and high evenness watersheds.  
- Note: *Sandhills* watersheds are *both high-export and high-evenness* ~ also two modes.  
- **New question**--what are driving clustering results?  
</div>

knitr::include_graphics("data/ecoplot_bootstrap.png")
```
</div>  

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) 

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:60%'>  
- **Trained GLMs** ~ 80/20 split, 5-fold cross-validation, selected best-fit model, fitted holdout data, and evaluated against a null model of mean daily flow depths.  

- *Response variable* = log(q1).  
- *Explanatory variables* = hydrologic landscape metrics, ecoregion, seasonality, trend.  
  
- **Hydrologic landscape metrics for GLM input** ~ derived as zonal statistics of 30m input rasters (N=15 metrics).

## Key findings 
- **Hydrologic export to streams depends on watershed storage** ~ watershed storage volume varies by ecoregion and antecedent moisture conditions 

- **Low export watersheds** are *boom and bust* ~ low water capture - drying out during mid-range to dry antecedent moisture conditions. **Low drought resilience streams** 
- **Moderate export watershed** storages active throughout a *wide range* of antecedent moisture conditions ~ **Moderate drought resilience streams**  
- **High export watershed** storages are *excess capacity* ~ attenuating overland flow.  Long-duration floods during high-flow conditions ~ **High drought resilience streams**

## Incorporating research | Meeting Tribal water resource information needs: 
* **Short-record or discontinued gages** ~ incorporate *regionalization by ecoregion* to extend records for flood-frequency analysis ~ partnering with SDSMT to begin in Spring 2000 for Pine Ridge White Clay district.
* **Ungaged watersheds** ~ use nearest gaged stations *selected by ecoregion* for streamflow estimation ~ Incorporation into 44 water quality stations without streamflow for load duration curves to improve water quality.   
* **Stream health metrics** ~ incorporate standardized precipitation indices into macroinvertebrate stream health metrics for EPA 106 & 319 reporting.

## Discussion 
- Lasso ~ parsimonious & similar performance to Elastic Net and Ridge regression ~ outperformed null model (e.g. lower MAE)
- Overall ~ vertical conductivity was the most important regression parameter
- Ecoregion scale, seasonality and trend were most important parameters 
- Conductivity and shape parameters also important **but differed among ecoregions**
- Conductivity and shape parameters also important **but differed among ecoregions**
3. **The antecedent moisture conditions when watershed storages are active differs by ecoregion.** 
- Low hydrologic export ecoregions have high seasonal and annual dependence. 
- Moderate export ecoregions exhibit moderate seasonal and annual dependence. 
- High export ecoregions exhibit low seasonal and annual dependence.

## Ecoregion drives hydrologic export
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:40%'>  
1. **Ecoregion drives hydrologic export**. 
2. Ecoregion & **vertical conductivity** covary & are most important parameters
3. Seasonality and annual trend are also important parameters
