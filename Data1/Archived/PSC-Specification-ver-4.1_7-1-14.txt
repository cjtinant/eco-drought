CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION, DEFINITIONS, AND RULES

CWT data must be exchanged in the form of a PSC Format Version 4.1 dataset.
The definition and specification of PSC Format Version 4.1 is described in this set of documents.
A.	Points of Data Exchange
Valid points of exchange are:
•	Canada site:  Mark Recovery Unit, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries & Oceans Canada
•	U.S. site:  Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Regional Mark Processing Center (hereafter “Mark Center”) http://www.rmpc.org
B.	Scheduled Frequency of Data Exchange
Any data should be exchanged as soon as it is considered to be complete.  The minimal schedule in which data needs to be exchanged is as follows:
1.	From the Mark Center to Canada:
a.	Release and Location datasets will be sent to Canada:
1)	when specifically requested by Canada, or
2)	within two weeks of validation and processing at the Mark Center
b.	Recovery, Catch/Sample, and Catch & Effort datasets will be sent to Canada:
1)	when specifically requested by Canada, or
2)	immediately upon validation and processing at the Mark Center
2.	From Reporting Agencies to the Mark Center: 
a.	Release:
1)	Mid-Year Release (CWT Only): Incomplete mid-year data records for the current calendar year (i.e. where first_release_date equals the current calendar year) should be reported no later than August 15 of the current calendar year.  Preliminary release data must include at a minimum all of the following fields:  record_code, format_version, submission_date, reporting_agency, release_agency, coordinator, tag_code_or_release_id, tag_type, species, brood_year, rearing_type, first_release_date, last_release_date, and hatchery_location_code.    NOTE:  Only the year portion of the first_release_date and last_release_date field is required.
2)	Final Release:  Complete data records for the current calendar year should be reported no later than January 31 of the following year.	
b.	Recovery:	Preliminary data for the current calendar year should be reported no later than January 31 of the following year.  This applies to Recovery records where field “Run Year” is equal to the current calendar year.
c.	Catch/Sample:	Preliminary data for the current calendar year should be reported no later than January 31 of the following year.  This applies to Catch/sample records where field “Catch Year” is equal to the current calendar year.
d.	Catch & Effort:	Preliminary data for the current calendar year should be reported no later than January 31 of the following year.  This applies to Catch & Effort records where field “Catch Year” is equal to the current calendar year.
e.	Location:	Locations can be sent whenever updates are deemed necessary by the reporting agency as required to validate data files mentioned above.
f.	Description: 	One corresponding Description file must be submitted with any data file mentioned above when submitted to the Mark Center.  However, a Description file should not be re-submitted when a data file is re-submitted solely for the purpose of correcting validation errors.  One and only one description file should be sent in association with a set of one or more data files for a given submission date.  In the event that more than one description file for the associated data file(s) is sent, only the latest description file uploaded for the given submission date will be processed for the database and also displayed on the Data Status web page.
C.	Required Grouping of Records within Data Type Files
1.	From Mark Center to Canada:
a.	Release:		All releases per file.
b.	Recovery:	One reporting agency, one run year, and all data to date per file.
c.	Catch/Sample:	One reporting agency, one catch year, and all data to date per file.
d.	Catch & Effort:	One reporting agency, one calendar year, and all data to date per file.
e.	Location:		All locations per file.
2.	From Reporting Agencies to the Mark Center:
a.	Release:		One reporting agency and any number of release records per file.
b.	Recovery:	One reporting agency, one run year, and all data to date per file.
c.	Catch/Sample:	One reporting agency, one catch year, and all data to date per file.
d.	Catch & Effort:	One reporting agency, one calendar year (date_catch_effort_year), and all data to date per file.
e.	Location:		One reporting agency and all Location Codes to date per file.
f.	Description:	One reporting agency and only new Descriptions since last submission per file.
For information on how to remove data records and submit full data sets, see Section H below.

D.	General Data File Requirements
1.	All PSC Format data must be presented in Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files using the ASCII character set;
2.	All files must contain only newline-delimited records (i.e. one record per line);
3.	The first record in the dataset must contain the corresponding “Data Field Names” as they are defined (with underscores replacing spaces) for the data type in this specification.
4.	All fields which contain a data value must not contain any leading or trailing blanks unless specifically allowed in the Description & Validation notes for a particular field;
5.	All fields which contain a data value must be surrounded on both ends by double-quotes (“) and must be separated by a comma (,);
6.	All fields which do not contain a data value (for whatever reason) are considered NULL values and must have NO representation whatsoever in the data file.  The fields for which data is absent will simply be represented by two consecutive commas (,,);
7.	No double-quotes (“) are allowed in the contents (i.e. values) of any data field because the double-quote (“) is sequestered for exclusive use as the delimiter character for data exchange;
8.	Leading zeros are optional unless they are part of a value in a lookup field.  An Example of a required leading zero as part of the value in a lookup field is: value ‘01’ for the Release coordinator field.  Decimal and trailing zeros are optional for numeric values in which all the digits after the decimal point would be zeros.  For numeric values with a fractional part the decimal should be present.  Implied decimals are not allowed;
9.	Data field types and ranges: 
•	All data specified as “Numeric” must contain only ASCII characters in the range:   ’0’ through ’9’ or a decimal character ’.’;
•	All data specified as “Lookup” are considered coded values having a corresponding lookup table, even if they appear numeric;
•	Date values should have neither blank ( ) nor zero (0) characters appended to optional components (i.e. in cases where only partial dates are permitted).  For example, the date August, 2001 should be formatted as follows:
•	Correct formatting:		“200108”
•	Incorrect formatting: 	“20010800”  or  “200108  “;

10.	Data file names must not contain any blank spaces.
E.	Methods of Data File Exchange
1.	Methods of file transfer may be any of the following:
•	Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) using the RMPC Internet web-site at the following address: http://www.rmpc.org
•	Internet File Transfer Protocol (FTP)  using an individual login account on the Mark Center computer;  FTP to this address: ftp.rmpc.org 
•	CD-ROM disc
2.	For file-transfer purposes, files may be compressed using PKZip, or Unix “gzip” file compression software;
F.	Explanation of Columns in Data Type Tables
1.	PSC Fld #	Field number for Format Version 4.1;
2.	PSC Common Name  Common usage name;
3.	Data Field Name  	Header record field name;
4.	Max Cols		Maximum field width (i.e. columns or bytes);
5.	Reqd		Required field.  May indicate one of the following:
•	Yes:	The field must contain data for the record to be considered a valid PSC Format record.
•	No:	The field is optional.  NOTE:  Some fields, however, are conditionally required;
6.	Format /Use	This column identifies how the field is to be interpreted and used for database management purposes.  It may contain any of the following:
•	‘Lookup’ 		The field contains codes that have a corresponding value in a lookup table.
•	‘Primary Key Lookup’ Field used to look up specific and distinct records within a data type. 
•	‘Foreign Key Lookup’ Field used to associate many records within a data type to specific and distinct records of another data type. 
•	‘Numeric’		The field can contain only numeric characters and can be treated as a mathematical quantity.
•	‘Alpha-Numeric’	The field can contain alpha and/or numeric characters and cannot be used as a mathematical quantity.
•	Data Type or List	 Possible values the field may contain.  The meaning of each value would be described in the “Validation” column.
•	Pattern Template	Shows the exact order and required contents of each character in the field;
7.	Validation Rules	This column will contain some combination of the following:
•	A brief explanation of the meaning of the field along with any pertinent notes to be aware of when determining a value to go in the field.
•	A list of meanings corresponding to the values listed in the Format column described in item 6 above.
•	Conditions under which the field is required, if any.
•	Ranges permitted in numeric data type fields.
•	Special values which have complex patterns or which are dependent on the contents of other fields;

H.    Methods of Removing Data Records (for one Reporting Agency)

  1.  Release:  To delete release records from the CWT/RMIS database, release data must be processed as a "full set" of releases.  To cause this to happen, please do the following:
        a.    Prepare a COMPLETE Releases data file for your Reporting Agency.  I.e. The file must include all legitimate records of releases from your Reporting Agency -- both tagged and untagged (records beginning with the "!" /Bang character) -- and for ALL HISTORY.
        b.    REMOVE any records that are now deemed not legitimate by your agency and you would like to have deleted from the CWT/RMIS database.
        c.    Place the following text into the filename:  "FULLSET".  I.e. the text "..FULLSET.." must appear somewhere in the actual name of the file uploaded to the RMPC.  The RMPC Data Administrator will look for the string "FULLSET" in the filename.  If seen, the administrator is to  process the data file as a full set of release data.  In that case, the database load process will compare all new records with all existing records (BOTH tagged and untagged) on file in the database.   For any tagged record not included, a check is done to determine if any recoveries exist where Tag Status = '1' for the tagcode.  If recoveries exist then the record will not be archived.  Any records not included in the new dataset that can be archived will be archived.  Thereafter the record(s) will be permanently deleted from the CWT database.  If any recoveries with Tag Status '1' exist for a tagcode then it cannot be deleted, regardless of the Reporting Agency.
        d.    Proceed w/ the FTP upload to the RMPC as with any other file (see Section E above).
       Please note that Release records may be sent as a partial dataset (i.e. any number of records from 1 up to all records for given agency, see Section C.2. a above); however, this method allows only replacement of existing release records or addition of new release records, not removal of release records.
  2.  Recovery:  To remove one or more recovery records from the CWT/RMIS database, simply remove the intended records from the recovery data set by Run Year, and re-submit the entire set of Recovery data (all remaining legitimate records) for the given Run Year to the RMPC (see Section C.2.b above).
  3.  Catch/Sample:  To remove one or more catch/sample records from the CWT/RMIS database, simply remove the intended records from the catch/sample data set by Catch Year, and re-submit the entire set of Catch/Sample data (all remaining legitimate records) for the given Catch Year to the RMPC (see Section C.2.c above).
  4.  Catch & Effort:  To remove one or more catch & effort records from the CWT/RMIS database, simply remove the intended records from the catch & effort data set by Calendar Year, and re-submit the entire set of Catch & Effort data (all remaining legitimate records) for the given Calendar Year to the RMPC (see Section C.2.d above).
  5.  Location:  To remove one or more location code records from the CWT/RMIS database, simply remove the intended records from the locations data set (all records) for the Location Reporting Agency, and re-submit the entire set of location codes (all remaining legitimate records) to the RMPC (see Section C.2.e above).   The database load process will compare all new records with all existing records on file in the database.  For any location code record not included, a check is done to determine if any data exist which reference that location code.  If any referenced data exist then the record will not be archived.  Any records not included in the new dataset that can be archived will be archived.   Thereafter the record(s) will be permanently deleted from the CWT/RMIS database.
  6.  Description:  Description data (metadata) are regarded as a permanent record of data changes and cannot be removed except by special request to the RMPC data administrator.
	  See also Section  C.2.f above.

Notes for sample_type:  (see also notes for Catch/Sample sample_type field #18)
1) Four keys are used to distinguish the type of sample:
a)  Sample:	In-sample or Voluntary
b)  Fishery:	Sampled or Unsampled
c)  Catch:		Known or Unknown
d)  Awareness:	Available or Unavailable
2) Awareness estimates (Sample Type Code 2) are based on current year’s data, while awareness approximations (Sample Type Code 3) are based on extrapolations of data from other periods or locations.
3) “Pass-through” Sampling (Sample Type Code 7)  In certain sampling programs, some fish are released while selected fish are killed and snouts removed.  The non-sampled fish are subject to subsequent destination sampling and the lack of reporting would result in underestimation of the tag codes.  In this sampling situation, the number of fish pulled out of the pass-through equals the number sampled and generally gives an estimated number of 1.

C.	EPA Reach Coding (USA Only)
The EPA Reach Number refers to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “reach file,” a national data base of surface water features.  The full EPA Reach Number is 17 characters in length.  It is based on the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) nationwide system of 8 digit Hydrologic-Unit Codes (HUC)s and can be used to identify stream reaches.  These reaches can identify  locations down to the level of stream intervals and coastal shoreline intervals.  EPA Reach is provided to facilitate the mapping of Location Codes pertaining to freshwater and shoreline locations.  Mapping of most marine locations may not be possible at this time.
To assist with mapping these locations, the following items are available on request from the Mark Center:
	Document:	EPA Reach File Manual
	Maps:	USGS Hydrologic Unit Maps (by State)
	Maps:	EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State)
The parts (components) of the EPA Reach Number that are permissible in the EPA Reach field are as follows  (See Figures 1 & 2 below): 
1.	Full EPA Reach Number (17 - char)
If possible, place the entire EPA Reach Number into the EPA Reach field.  This will be possible only for certain types of locations that refer to point locations such as hatchery / facilities, or known release locations.  Specific values can be obtained by referring to the maps:  EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State).  
2.	Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) portion only (8 - char)
In many cases it will not be possible to map a CWT Location Code to a 17-character EPA Reach Number.  This situation arises when the Location Code refers to an entire river, bay, lake, or other general area.  For example, the release location Newaukum R [3F21802  230882 R  ] encompasses many stream reaches within the EPA Reach-coded HUC:  [17100103].  In these cases, the solution is to use only part of the EPA Reach Number in the Reach field—the 8 character HUC.  HUC values may be obtained by referring to either of these maps:  USGS Hydrologic Unit Maps (by State);  EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State).
3.	Accounting Unit Code portion only (6 - char)
If the Location Code encompasses more than one HUC, then use the Accounting Unit Code portion of the HUC.  Accounting Unit Code values may be obtained by refer¬ring to either of these maps:  USGS Hydrologic Unit Maps (by State);  EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State).
4.	Sub-region Unit Code portion only (4 - char)
	If the Location Code encompasses more than one Accounting Unit Code, then use the Sub-region Unit Code portion of the Accounting Unit Code.  All permissible val¬ues are listed here. (for assistance, refer to the either of these maps:  USGS Hydrologic Unit Maps (by State);  EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State).)   EPA Reach must contain one of these:


1701		Kootenai / Pend Oreille / Spokane sub-region
1702		Upper Columbia sub-region
1703		Yakima sub-region
1704		Upper Snake sub-region
1705		Middle Snake sub-region
1706		Lower Snake sub-region
1707		Middle Columbia sub-region
1708		Lower Columbia sub-region
1709		Willamette sub-region
1710		Oregon-Washington Coastal sub-region
1711		Puget sub-region
1712		Oregon-Closed Basins sub-region
1801		Klamath-North California Coast sub-region
1802		Sacramento sub-region
1901		Alaska-Southeast sub-region
1902		Alaska-Central sub-region
1903		Alaska-Kuskokwim sub-region
1904		Alaska-Yukon sub-region
1905		Alaska-Northwestern sub-region
1906		Alaska-Arctic sub-region
5.	Region Unit Code portion only (2 - char)
If the Location Code encompasses more than one Sub-region Unit Code, then use the Region Unit Code portion of the Sub-region Unit Code.  All permissible values are listed here. (for assistance, refer to the either of these maps:  USGS Hydrologic Unit Maps (by State);  EPA River Reach File Hydrologic Segment Plots (by State).)  EPA Reach must contain one of these:
17	Pacific Northwest region
18	California region
19	Alaska region

CHAPTER 14
MARK (Adclip) SAMPLING
A.	Mark (Adclip) Sampling - General 
The method to mark sample to calculate an unbiased mark (adclip) rate will depend upon whether the tag detection method is visual or electronic.
a.	When the tag detection method is visual, all fish in the sample are examined for an adipose clip.  All adipose-clipped fish are presumed to have a cwt and are included in the recovery file.  Mark sampling occurs as part of the process of cwt sampling.  (See Figure 1 below).
b.	When the tag detection method is electronic, all fish in the sample are electronically wanded or tubed. All positive-signal ('beep') fish are presumed to have a cwt and are included in the recovery file. Mark sampling can occur as follows:
1)	Mark sampling can be dependent on the electronic signal.  The sample is divided into a 'signal' partition and a 'no-signal' partition.  All fish in each partition, all fish in one partition and a random sub-sample of all fish in the other partition,  or a random sub-sample of all fish in each partition must be examined for an adipose clip. (see Figure 2 below). Typically, the 'Signal' partition is not sub-sampled since all fish will be processed as cwt recoveries.
An unbiased mark rate can only be calculated if both partitions are examined for adclips.  For example, if the 'signal' partition is examined for adclips but the 'no-signal' partition is not examined for adclips, a mark rate for the SAMPLE cannot be calculated, even though it is possible to calculate a mark rate for the 'signal' partition.
2)	Mark sampling can be independent of the electronic signal.  All fish in the sample or a random sub-sample of all fish in the sample must be examined for an adipose clip (see Figure 3 below).
If a sample is examined for adclips apart from electronic detection or as fish are wanded, the mark sampling is independent of the electronic detection. If fish are separated into two partitions as a result of the electronic wand or tube signal, and each partition is examined for adclips, the mark sampling is dependent on the electronic signal.
Whether or not mark sampling is dependent or independent of the electronic detection, as in Figures 2 and 3, any subsampling of fish in each partition or in the sample will affect the usefulness of the mark rate and should be examined to ensure the subsampling adequately represents the fish in the partition or sample.  The mark rate calculation assumes that the subsampling is random and adequately representative of all fish.   For example, if all fish in the 'signal' partition are examined for adclips, but only 2 out of 500 fish in the 'no-signal' partition are examined, it is possible to calculate a mark rate for the SAMPLE using the formula but its usefulness should be questioned since 2 fish out of 500 does not adequately represent the 'no-signal' fish in the sample.
 
Figure 1:   Illustration of Mark Sampling when Tag Detection Method is Visual	Figure 2:   Illustration of Mark Sampling Dependent  on Electronic Signal, when Tag Detection Method is Electronic	Figure 3:   Illustration of Mark Sampling Independent of Electronic Signal, when Tag Detection Method is Electronic
 	 	 
 
B.	Mark (Adclip) Sampling - PSC Catch/Sample Fields used for Data Exchange
The usage of the PSC Catch Sample fields depends upon the tag detection method and whether mark sampling was dependent upon electronic partitioning or is independent of the electronic signal.
c.	When the tag detection method is visual, only the 1st set of 'mr_' fields (mr_1st_xxx) should be used.  The  2nd set of mr_ fields (mr_2nd_xxx) must be absent.  (See Figure 4 below). 
d.	When the tag detection method is electronic, the usage of the 1st set of 'mr_' fields (mr_1st_xxx) and the 2nd set of mr_ fields (mr_2nd_xxx) depends upon whether mark sampling is dependent or independent of the electronic signal.
1)	When the tag detection method is electronic and mark sampling is dependent on the electronic partitioning, both sets of mr_ fields should be used.  The first set (mr_1st_xxx) represents the 'Signal' partition.  The second set (mr_2nd_xxx) represents the 'No Signal' partition. (See Figure 5,6 and 7 below).
2)	When the tag detection method is electronic and mark sampling is independent of the electronic signal, only the 1st set of mr_ fields (mr_1st_xxx) should be used.  The  2nd set of mr_ fields (mr_2nd_xxx) must be absent.  (see Figure 8 and 9 below).
Figure 4: Illustration of PSC data fields used when tag detection method is visual
 	All fish in the sample are treated as one partition so P1 = number of fish in the sample 
Sample is not subsampled so S1=number of fish in the sample
Since all fish in Sample were visually sampled, all fish in Sample have 'determinable and therefore known' adclip status so K1=number of fish in the sample
All recoveries have adclips so A1 = number of fish in the sample with an adclip = total fish in corresponding recovery file

mark_rate (MR)	MR = [estimated marks in P1 + estimated marks in P2] / (total fish in P1 and P2)
       = [(P1 * A1/K1) + (P2 * A2/K2)] / (P1 + P2)
If K1 or K2 is ‘0’ absent, then mark_rate cannot be calculated and must remain blank.

CHAPTER 15
Release Count and Mark Code Fields

A.	Version 4.1 Release Count and Mark Code Fields
The intention of the version 4.1 count and mark code fields is to provide a physical view of release counts and marks. Changes to the method of reporting release counts and marks were necessary due to the desequestering of the adipose clip to indicate a coded-wire tagged fish.  The changes enable the user to calculate the number of adipose clipped fish in a release group, whether or not they are coded-wire tagged.  The changes also permit the reporting of up to two different marks for CWT or Non-CWT (fish that do not contain a CWT) fish in a release. 
Each  Reporting Agency may have a different usage for each release count and mark code field.  The agency may determine the particular order of usage of count and mark code fields; therefore no information is implied by the ordering of values in count and mark code fields.
Under version 4.1 specifications, the following fields are used to report release counts and mark codes (Figure 1):
Figure 1: Illustration of Version 4.1 Mark & Count Fields
Field No.	PSC Common Name	Description
		CWT Release Group	Unassociated Release Group
F28	CWT 1st Mark	Mark(s)  on CWT fish corresponding to count value in CWT 1st Mark Count (F29)	not applicable
F29	CWT 1st Mark Count	Number of CWT fish corrected for tag loss and mortality with CWT 1st Mark (F28)	not applicable
F30	CWT 2nd Mark	Mark(s) on CWT fish corresponding to count value in CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31) 
(only used if CWT tagged fish have 2 different mark codes)	not applicable
F31	CWT 2nd Mark Count	Number of CWT fish corrected for tag loss and mortality with CWT 2nd Mark (F30) 
(only used if CWT tagged fish have 2 different mark codes)	not applicable
F32	Non-CWT 1st Mark	Mark(s) on non-CWT fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 1st  Mark Count (F33)	Mark(s) on fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 1st  Mark Count (F33)
F33	Non-CWT 1st Mark Count	Number of fish with No CWT with Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32)	Number of fish with Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32)
F34	Non-CWT 2nd Mark	Mark(s) on non-CWT fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 2nd  Mark Count (F35) 
(only used if fish with No CWT have 2 different mark codes)	Mark(s) on fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 2nd  Mark Count (F35)
(only used if fish with No CWT have 2 different mark codes)
F35	Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count	Number of fish with No CWT with Non-CWT 2nd  Mark (F34)
(only used if fish with No CWT have 2 different mark codes)	Number of fish with Non-CWT 2nd  Mark (F34) 
(only used if fish with No CWT have 2  different mark codes)
F37	Tag Loss Rate	Proportion of fish which shed the CWT from the tag loss sample (expressed as a decimal percentage)	not applicable
 

 
The use of the release mark and count fields depends upon whether the release group is reported as a CWT release group (Record_Code [Field 1] = 'T' -- release group contains any number of coded wire tagged fish) or a Unassociated (to CWTs) release group (Record_Code [Field 11] = 'N' -- release group contains no coded wire tagged fish).
a.	For CWT Release Records, CWT 1st Mark (F28), CWT 2nd Mark (F30), Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32), and Non-CWT 2nd Mark (F34) are used to report marks.  CWT 1st Mark Count (F29), CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31), Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33) and Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count (F35) are used to report counts. Tag Loss Rate (F37) is used to report the rate of CWT loss.   
If cwt fish all have the same mark, only CWT 1st Mark (F28) and CWT 1st Mark Count (F29) are used.  If cwt fish have 2 different marks, CWT 1st Mark (F28), CWT 1st Mark Count (F29), CWT 2nd Mark (F30), and CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31) are used.  No specific information is implied by using the 1st or 2nd set of CWT mark/count fields, when both sets of fields are used.

If fish that did not contain a CWT when released (including fish that were tagged and shed cwt) all have the same mark, only Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32) and non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33) are used.  

If fish that did not contain a CWT when released have 2 different marks, Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32), Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33), Non-CWT 2nd Mark (F34) and Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count (F35) are used. No specific information is implied by using the 1st or 2nd set of Non-CWT mark/count fields when both sets of fields are used.  (i.e. The number of fish that were tagged and shed CWT may be reported in the 1st set of Non-CWT mark/count fields or the 2nd set of Non-CWT mark/count fields.)

The number of fish released with a CWT is the sum of CWT 1st Mark Count (F29) + CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31).  
The number of fish released without a CWT is the sum of Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33) + Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count (F35). 
The number of fish released with an adipose clip is the sum of the Mark Counts where the related mark begins with a '5'.
The number of fish released without an adipose clip is the sum of the Mark Counts where the related Mark begins with a '0'.
The number of CWT fish released with an adipose clip is the sum of the CWT Mark Counts where the related CWT Mark begins with a '5'. 
The number of CWT fish released without an adipose clip is the sum of the CWT Mark Counts where the related CWT Mark begins with a '0'. 
The number of Non-CWT fish released with an adipose clip is the sum of the Non-CWT Mark Counts where the related CWT Mark begins with a '5'. 
The number of Non-CWT fish released without an adipose clip is the sum of the Non-CWT Mark Counts where the related CWT Mark begins with a '0'. The total number of fish released can be calculated by summing the Mark Counts (1st Mark Count (F29) + CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31) + Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33) + Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count (F35)).  

The number of fish that were tagged and shed CWT must be calculated from the Tag Loss Rate (F37) and the number of fish released with a CWT (CWT 1st Mark Count (F29) + CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31) ).  The formula is:
= Tag Loss Rate (F37) * (CWT 1st Mark Count (F29) + CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31) / (1 - Tag Loss Rate (F37))
b.	For Unassociated Release Records,  Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32) and Non-CWT 2nd Mark (F34) are used to report the marks.  Non-CWT 1st Mark Count and Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count are used to report the counts. Other fields (CWT 1st Mark (F28), CWT 1st Mark Count (F29), CWT 2nd Mark (F30), CWT 2nd Mark Count (F31), Tag Loss Rate (F37)) are required to be blank for unassociated releases.
If all fish have the same mark, only Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32) and Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33) are used.  If fish have 2 different marks, Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32), Non-CWT 1st Mark Count (F33), Non-CWT 2nd Mark (F34) and Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count (F35) are used. No specific information is implied by using the 1st or 2nd set of Non-CWT mark/count fields when both sets of fields are used.
 
The number of fish released with an adipose clip is the sum of the Mark Counts where the related Mark begins with a '5'.
The number of fish released without an adipose clip is the sum of the Mark Counts where the related Mark begins with a '0'. 
The total number of fish released can be calculated by summing the Mark Counts.

CHAPTER 16
Pseudo Tags (Blank or Agency-Only Wire)
Blank wire tags and agency-only wire tags are not coded wire tags (CWTs).   They physically look like CWTs, are injected in the same manner as CWTs and have similar magnetic properties enabling them to trigger automatic diversion gates and electronic CWT detectors;  However, blank wire and agency-only wire tags do not possess a specific etched binary or decimal code and, upon recovery, cannot be resolved to a specific tag code.  Throughout this document, the term "pseudo tag" is used for blank wire tags and agency-only wire tags.
Pseudo tags placed in the head or snout region  must be reported due to the desequestering of the adipose clip and the advent of electronic tag detection. Body-placed pseudo tags have not been reported before version 4.1 but may now be reported.
A.	How to report Pseudo Tag Releases 
All release groups possessing pseudo tags must be tagged entirely with the same type of wire.  Mixing of blank wire and agency-only wire, pseudo tags and CWTs, or pseudo tags and non-tagged fish in the same release group is not permitted.
A release group containing pseudo tags is reported as a non-associated release record (Figure 1).  It is not a CWT release group.  All CWT release fields (CWT 1st Mark Count, CWT 1st Mark, CWT 2nd Mark Count, CWT 2nd Mark, Tag Loss Rate, Tag Loss Days, Tag Loss Sample Size, Tag Reused) must be blank.  
Figure 1: Version 4.1 Release Fields Used to Report Pseudo Tags
Field No.	PSC Format Name	Description	Required Value
F1	Record Code	Code to indicate the CWT data file classification (class) of the individual record.	'N' - non-associated release record
F7	Tag Code or Release ID	Unique Release ID to identify the release group.	Column 1 must be '!'
Columns 2 and 3 must match one of the valid coordinator codes for the Releases Coordinator field
F8	Tag Type	Code to indicate type of tag used for release group	'16' - Pseudo tag, blank wire
F32	Non-CWT 1st Mark	Mark(s) on fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 1st  Mark Count (F33)	
F33	Non-CWT 1st Mark Count	Number of fish with Non-CWT 1st Mark (F32)	
F34	Non-CWT 2nd Mark	Mark(s) on fish corresponding to count value in Non CWT 2nd  Mark Count (F35)	(only used if fish have 2 different mark codes)
F35	Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count	Number of fish with Non-CWT 2nd  Mark (F34) 	(only used if fish have two different mark codes)
Table 1: Examples of Version 4.1 Release Fields Used to Report Pseudo Tags
Example 	Record Code	Tag Code or Release ID	Tag Type	Non-CWT 1st Mark	Non-CWT 1st Mark Count	Non-CWT 2nd Mark	Non-CWT 2nd Mark Count
	(F1)	(F7)	(F8)	(F32)	(F33)	(F34)	(F35)
All fish in release group are tagged with blank wire and have one mark.  
e.g., 9000 fish tagged with blank wire and LV marked.	N	!ccxxxxxxxxx, where 'cc' is a valid coordinator code and 'xxxxxxxxx' is unique,
e.g., !040001, for WDFW blank wire release	16	0001	9,000	 	 
All fish in release group are tagged with agency-only  wire and have one mark.
e.g., 9000 fish tagged with agency-only wire and LV marked.	N	!ccxxxxxxxxx,  
e.g., !040002, for WDFW blank wire release	16	0001	9,000	 	 
All fish in release group are tagged with blank wire.  Fish have two mark codes.
e.g., All fish tagged with blank wire:  6000 LV, 3000 no mark.	N	!ccxxxxxxxxx, 
e.g., !040003, for WDFW agency-only wire 	16	5001	6,000	0000	3,000
All fish in release group are tagged with agency-only wire.  Fish have two mark codes.
e.g., All fish tagged with blank wire:  6000 LV, 3000 no mark.	N	!ccxxxxxxxxx, 
e.g., !040004, for WDFW agency-only wire 	16	5001	6,000	0000	3,000
Fish in release group are tagged with agency-only wire  and blank wire.	This cannot be reported in one release record -- The release group must be separated into two non-associated release records.  The relationship can be reported using the Related Group Type (F11) and Related Group ID (F12) fields.
Fish in release group are tagged with pseudo tags and CWTs	This cannot be reported in one release record -- The release group must be separated into a CWT release record and a non-associated release record.  The relationship can be reported using the Related Group Type (F11) and Related Group ID (F12) fields.
Some fish in release group are tagged with pseudo tags.  Other fish are not tagged.	This cannot be reported in one release record -- The release group must be separated into two non-associated release records.  The relationship can be reported using the Related Group Type (F11) and Related Group ID (F12) fields.

 
B.	How to Report Pseudo Tag Recoveries 
Pseudo tag recoveries are reported using three Recovery fields (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Version 4.1 Recovery Fields Used to Report Pseudo Tags
Field No.	PSC Format Name	Description	Required Value
F28	Tag Status	Code to indicate status of the tag recovery	'9' - Pseudo tag, blank wire
F29	Tag Code	Identifier coded on a tag to denote a release group	'BLANK' - for blank wire tag
'D1BLANK', where 'D1' is the numeric agency wire prefix (i.e. Data 1)  - for agency-only wire tag
F30	Tag Type	Code to indicate type of tag wire found in the recovery snout	'16' - Pseudo tag, blank wire
Table 2: Examples of Version 4.1 Recovery Fields Used to Report Pseudo Tags
Example 	Tag Status	Tag Code 	Tag Type
	(F28)	(F29)	(F30)
Blank wire recovery	9	BLANK	16
Agency only wire recovery	9	D1BLANK, where 'D1' is the numeric agency wire prefix (i.e. Data 1) 
e.g., 63BLANK, for WDFW agency-only wire	16

Pseudo tag recoveries in sampled fisheries are reported using only one Catch Sample field (Figure 3).
